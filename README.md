# Project Title
The purpose of this project is to explore the RTAB map ROS package and get familiar with it. There is a detailed report "Project_Report.pdf" explaining my findings and difficulties faced when using the package.

## Getting Started
I followed the procedure outlined by the package owners to generate get the package up and running. To get this code up and running, RTAB map must be installed on the machine.

## Achievement:
Generated a 2D and a 3D map of 2 environments, a custom made environment and a generic one provided by Gazebo. 
The robot used was a basic custom made robot with kinect sensor and LIDAR sensor.

This project was a part of the Udacity nanodegree.
